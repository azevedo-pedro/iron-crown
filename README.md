📚 **JavaScript Study Project Portfolio** 📚

Welcome to my JavaScript Study Project Portfolio! Here, I document my journey of learning and mastering JavaScript through practical projects that showcase my skills and understanding of the language.

🔍 **Project Highlights:**

**Module 1. Talk about Tests:**
   - 1.1: Work with mocks
   - 1.2: Work with stubs
   - 1.3: Work with spies
   - 1.4: Work with tests end-to-end and coverage
   - Final project about tests.

**Module 2. Concepts foundations about JavaScript lifecycle:**
   - 2.1: Strict Mode
   - 2.2: Call stack and memory heap
   - 2.3: Value type vs. referential type (immutability vs mutability)
   - 2.4: Type Coercion & Object Lifecycle: toString, valueOf, and Symbol.toPrimitive
   - 2.5: Prototype Chain

🚀 **Learning Journey:**
Throughout these projects, I've delved deep into JavaScript fundamentals, including variables, data types, control flow, functions, and object-oriented programming concepts. I've also explored advanced topics such as asynchronous programming, API integration, and modern JavaScript features like arrow functions and destructuring assignments.

📚 **Future Plans:**
Continuing my JavaScript journey, I aim to explore frameworks and libraries such as React.js and Node.js to build more sophisticated web applications. I'm also keen on diving into backend development with Express.js and MongoDB to create full-stack JavaScript applications.

🌟 **Goal:** My ultimate goal is to become a proficient full-stack JavaScript developer and contribute to innovative projects that make a positive impact on people's lives.

Let's connect and learn together! 🌟
